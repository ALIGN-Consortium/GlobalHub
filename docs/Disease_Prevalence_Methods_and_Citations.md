## Methods: Disease Prevalence Estimates

Global disease prevalence estimates were obtained from authoritative international sources. HIV prevalence estimates were derived from **UNAIDS Global HIV & AIDS Statistics (2023–2024)**. Tuberculosis prevalence estimates were informed by the **WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2023**, and malaria prevalence estimates by the **WHO World Malaria Report 2023**.

For pregnancy-related conditions (including preterm birth and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy such as preeclampsia and eclampsia), prevalence was approximated using indicators from the **WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) maternal and reproductive health database**, informed by **Global Burden of Disease (GBD)** maternal conditions analyses conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

These prevalence values were used as **global reference measures** to support comparative market-introduction and prioritization analyses, rather than as country-specific epidemiologic estimates.
