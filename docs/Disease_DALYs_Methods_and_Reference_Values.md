# Disease Burden (DALYs) Estimates: Methods and Reference Values

## Methods: DALYs Attribution by Target Population

Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were used as a summary measure of disease burden to support comparative market-introduction and prioritization analyses across health product target populations. DALYs combine years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs), and are a standard metric used in the **Global Burden of Disease (GBD)** study coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

For this analysis, **global DALY reference values** were assigned to each `target_population` category using publicly reported GBD estimates for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and maternal disorders. DALYs were mapped at the level of **disease group and broad age category** (adult, pediatric, all ages), consistent with the analytical resolution of the product portfolio. Pregnancy-related target populations (including preterm birth, preeclampsia, and eclampsia) were mapped to **maternal disorders DALYs** as a proxy.

These DALY values are intended to serve as **order-of-magnitude global reference estimates**, enabling relative comparison across product populations. They are not intended to replace country-, year-, age-, or sex-specific DALY estimates derived directly from GBD microdata.

## Interpretation and Limitations

- DALY values represent **global aggregates** and reflect the most recent GBD estimates available at the time of analysis.
- Age-specific DALYs (adult vs pediatric) were approximated based on known age distributions of disease burden reported in GBD analyses.
- Pregnancy-related DALYs correspond to **maternal disorders**, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and complications related to preterm birth; these were used as a proxy for pregnancy-targeted products.
- These estimates should be interpreted as **comparative indicators of burden**, suitable for portfolio prioritization and strategic planning, rather than precise epidemiologic measurements.
